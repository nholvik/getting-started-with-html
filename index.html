<h1> Nick's Notes</h1>
<b>HTML</b>
<br>
<p><em>HTML</em> is made up of:
<br>
-text content<br>-Mark up<br>-References<br>-Links to to other pages
</p>
<p><em>HTML MARK UP</em></p>
HTML is consisted of tags. You will typically have an opening tag and a closing tag <br>
<br>
For example < b > is a bold tag.<br>
<br>
<B> HTML Attributes</B><br>
<br>
Certain tags have attributes, you can use the A HREF tag used to hyperlink. <br>
I can create a link by using the A HREF tag. For example, <a href ="www.google.com"> This clicking this link will take you to google</a><br>
<br>
You can also use the img tag to add an image to your webapage. To do this, you have to use the < img src = "url" alt = "text" > tag. For example, i'm adding this image of Hawaii by doing so: <br> 
<br>
<img src="http://www.astonhotels.com/assets/slides/690x380-Hawaii-Sunset.jpg" alt="I do not own this image of Hawaii">
<br>
<br>
When you use a img tag, it is a <b><em>void tag</em></b> because you do not need to use a closing tag.<br>
Also, if the link is broken, the "text" part of the tag will appear. This is also useful for blind people.<br> 
<br>
<br>
<b>Line Breaks</b><br>
You can use the tag < BR > to create a <em>line break</em><br>
......This is also a void tag<br>
Another tag you can use for a line break is the < P > tag, which is <em>not</em> void.
<br>
<br>
<b> Inline/Block</b><br>
<br>
< br > is used inline
< p > is block, it kind of creates an invisible box around the text where you can change the width and height<br>
<br>
<em><b>inline elements</b></em><br>
- < br ><br>
- < em ><br>
- < img ><br>
...the only block element we've learnt so far is < P ><br>
<br>
<br>
<B> Span/Div</B><br>
Span - Inline<br>
Div - Block<br>
...these do nothing, but contain content<br>
